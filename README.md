# PROG 02: Represent!

Well, while making this app i really was plunged headfirst into apis and really spent a lot of time figureing things out but failed so hard. Due to technical issues, I personally was not able to test out the phone-> watch part beyond part 2B because my computer kept crashing, so I do not think my watch emulator can handle my app?
