# PROG 02: Represent!

Well, while making this app i really was plunged headfirst into apis and really spent a lot of time figureing things out but failed so hard. Due to technical issues, I personally was not able to test out the phone-> watch part beyond part 2B because my computer kept crashing, so I do not think my watch emulator can handle my app? Hopefully graders can test it and tell me if it works. I spent a lot of time on this project and am not sure whether to be disappointed in my programming skills/poor results. 

The app itself currently only is able to implement the sunshine api and the location api on the watch and on the mobile app. I have not integrated twitter, or the shaking.
